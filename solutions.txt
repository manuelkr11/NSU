What is the difference between git and github?
Git is a version control system that allows developers to manage and track changes to their code over time. It is a command-line tool that can be used locally on a developer's machine. GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories. It provides a centralized platform for developers to store and collaborate on Git repositories, as well as additional features such as issue tracking, pull requests, and code review tools.

Name 3 benefits of a version control system:
- Version control systems allow for the tracking of changes to code over time, making it easier to roll back to previous versions if necessary.
- They enable multiple developers to collaborate on the same codebase without conflicts or confusion, with the ability to merge changes together.
- They provide a centralized location for code storage and collaboration, which can help improve organization, documentation, and transparency.

Name 3 alternatives to git:
- Mercurial
- Subversion (SVN)
- Perforce

Name 2 differences between git and other version control systems:
- Git is a distributed version control system, which means that every developer has a full copy of the repository, including the entire history of changes. Other version control systems like Subversion (SVN) are centralized, which means that there is a single server that contains the repository.
- Git uses a content-addressable filesystem to store and manage changes to files, while other version control systems use delta-based storage mechanisms. This allows Git to handle large codebases more efficiently and with better performance.

Name known issues related to game engines (Unreal, Unity) and version control systems:
- One common issue with game engines such as Unreal and Unity is that they generate large binary files, such as textures and models, that are difficult to manage and version with traditional version control systems. This can result in slow performance and large repository sizes.
- Another issue is that game engine projects often involve multiple developers working on different components of the game, which can lead to conflicts and merge issues when changes are made simultaneously. This can be compounded by the fact that game engines often have complex file structures and dependencies between files.

Describe a logging system with your own words:
A logging system is a software tool that records information about the events occurring in a computer application (ore even a computer system). It can also stores the information and therefore is useful for troubleshooting issues and/or monitoring and upgrading system performance.

What is the difference between git submodules and git subtrees?
Both git submodules and git subtrees are tools that allow developers to include and manage code from external repositories within a git repository. Git submodules allow external repositories to be included as separate submodules in a git repository, while git subtrees allow external repositories to be merged and treated as part of the main repository.

What is a build system in C++? Name 3 build systems:
A build system is a software tool or set of tools that automates the process of compiling source code into executable programs or libraries. A build system typically manages dependencies, compiles source code, links object files, and generates the final executable or library.
- premake5 (as used in our project by the cherno)
- CMake
- GNU Make

What is a package manager in C++? Name 3 package manager:
A package manager is a software tool or system that automates the process of installing, upgrading, and managing libraries, dependencies, and other software components used in C++ projects. A package manager typically provides a centralized repository of packages, metadata about packages, and tools to download and install packages.
- Conan
- Vcpkg
- Cget
